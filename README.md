# Data-Analysis-on-Dogs
Utilized data science and data visualization to perform analysis on a dog dataset sourced from the AKC (American Kennel Club).
 

## What I did
* Programmed on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook 
* Used [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data processing, manipulation, and analysis
* Used [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization such as generating scatterplots models
* Used [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for computational applications such as quadratic and linear regression
* Programmed and implemented various data processing functions to clean up dataset
